# bulk-RNA-seq-data-analysis
bulk RNA seq data analysis of different gene expression between Na√Øve CD4 t-cells and memory t-cells after stimulating the cells to different types of cytokines
## the data is reprocessed from a puplished paper 
Cano-Gamez, E., Soskic, B., Roumeliotis, T.I. et al. Single-cell transcriptomics identifies an effectorness gradient shaping the response of CD4+ T cells to cytokines. Nat Commun 11, 1801 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15543-y
## note that the analysis begins with mapped RNA matrix data
